Halo Content Resigner

HaloSigner is a simple utility which allows users to rehash certain types of Halo content files after they have been modified with a hex editor.
Currently, campaign saves and GPDs from Halo 3 and Halo: Reach are supported.

Simply drag a raw content file (e.g. an mmiof.bmf) into the program and it will be rehashed.
